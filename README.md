# dataCleaning

The purpose here is to clean a dataset with different sources of information. First thing first we had to find the possible duplicates in the dataset.
Then we have to filter what would be the relevant columns to keep.
For example a column with too much missing values wouldn't be relevant.

Then to get really familiar with the data we will provide some visualizations.
